# Tips, Tricks and Tutorials
Resources, articles, tutorials and recommended packages etc. Feel free to add links to helpful resources for the rest of the club to share.

## How to contribute
Like this readme, the resources shared here should be added as markdown files (filename.md) that cover a specific category. There's one for [base R](https://github.com/StirlingCodingClub/tips-tricks-n-tuts/blob/master/docs/baseR.md) added to get things started. If you found any good sites that helped you with R, go ahead and add a link.

Here are some tips on [mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for those that haven't used it before.

### Discussion

If you have a suggestion, but don't want to add it straight to these docs, add your link to an issue (in the tabs above) instead for discussion. The discussion board could also be used to chat about any of the resources thaat you've found via this repository.
